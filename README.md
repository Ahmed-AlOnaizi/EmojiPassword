# EmojiPassword

 ### What Can Be Evaluated
Usability Aspects

Ease of Use: How easy or intuitive is the emoji-based interface compared to traditional passwords?
Efficiency (Time & Effort): How long does it take users to create and log in with an emoji password? Do they make more or fewer errors?
Memorability: Are users able to recall their emoji passwords after a delay (e.g., after 10 minutes, 24 hours, or a week)?
User Satisfaction / Experience: How do users feel about the emoji-based system—do they find it fun, frustrating, confusing, or novel?
Security Aspects

Password Strength: How large is the theoretical password space (e.g., number of unique emojis × password length)?
Guessability: Are users picking predictable emoji sequences (e.g., “❤️❤️❤️❤️”)?
Error Rates: How often do users enter the wrong emojis when logging in? Does it lead to insecure coping strategies (like writing down emojis)?
Perceived Security: Do participants believe emoji-based passwords are more or less secure compared to alphanumeric passwords?
Additional Considerations

Comparison to Baseline: You may compare emoji-based passwords to a standard text-based password system (or a different variant of emoji-based input) to see which one performs better.
Impact of Different Emoji Sets: Does the size or type of emoji set matter (e.g., only facial emojis vs. wide variety)?
Feedback & Error Messages: How does the system communicate password strength or login failure to the user?
2. Possible Independent Variables
The independent variables (IVs) are the factors you manipulate or compare. For an emoji-based authentication study, you might have one or multiple IVs:

Authentication Method (common choice)

Emoji-based password vs. Alphanumeric password (text-based)
Emoji-only vs. Emoji+Text combos
Emoji Set or Input Mechanism

Small set of emojis vs. Large set of emojis.
Grid-based selection vs. Typing shortcodes (like :smile:).
Allow repeated emojis vs. No repeats.
Length Constraint

Short emoji passwords (e.g., 4 emojis) vs. Longer (e.g., 6 or 8 emojis).
Or a comparison of required complexity (must use 1 face emoji, 1 symbol, 1 object, etc.).
Device / Platform

If relevant, comparing usage on mobile vs. desktop.
In many studies, you’ll pick one main independent variable (e.g., “type of password system”) if you want to keep things straightforward.

3. Possible Dependent Variables
The dependent variables (DVs) are what you measure or observe in the study:

Time-based Metrics

Registration Time: How long it takes to create or set up the password.
Login Time: How long it takes to successfully log in.
Error Rates & Success Rates

Login Errors: Number of failed login attempts before success.
Forgotten Passwords: Whether a user fails to recall their emoji password entirely.
Memorability / Retention

Recall Success: After a delay (e.g., 10 minutes, a day, a week), do participants remember their emoji password?
Number of Attempts needed to log in after the delay.
Subjective Usability Ratings

Perceived Ease of Use: e.g., post-task questionnaire (System Usability Scale, NASA-TLX for workload, or custom Likert-scale questions).
User Satisfaction: Do users like it better than conventional passwords?
Perceived Security: On a Likert scale: “Do you believe this method is secure?”
Security Indicators (if feasible)

Entropy Estimate: Based on user’s chosen emoji sequences, how large is the effective password space? (You can analyze the actual passwords chosen—if participants allow it—to estimate guessability.)
4. Example Study Design
Below are a couple of possible designs:

A) Within-Subjects Design
Independent Variable: Password type (Emoji-based vs. Text-based).
Participants: Each participant tries both methods (randomize the order).
Dependent Variables:
Registration time, login time, error rate, memorability after a delay, subjective rating, etc.
Procedure:
Participant creates a text-based password. Times are measured.
Participant logs in with it (immediate).
Participant creates an emoji-based password, logs in with it.
After a short break (or the next day), measure how easily they recall each password.
Collect subjective feedback.
B) Between-Subjects Design
Independent Variable: Password type (Emoji-based vs. Text-based).
Participants: Half the participants use only the emoji system, and half use only text.
Dependent Variables: Same as above.
Procedure: Each group uses just one method. Compare overall results.
C) Multiple Emoji Conditions
Independent Variable: Different designs of the emoji-based system (e.g., small emoji set vs. large emoji set).
Dependent Variables: Time, error, memory, subjective preference.
Procedure: Have participants try both versions or split participants between the two versions.
5. Examples of How to Tie Them Together
Hypothesis: “Emoji-based passwords will be faster to create than text-based passwords but might take longer to enter at login due to searching for specific emojis.”

IV: Type of password (Emoji-based vs. Text-based).
DVs: Time to create, time to log in, error rate, user preference.
Hypothesis: “Users will remember emoji passwords better after 24 hours than alphanumeric ones.”

IV: Type of password (Emoji vs. Alphanumeric).
DVs: Successful recall rate, time to recall, confidence rating.
Hypothesis: “Requiring a longer emoji password (6 emojis) increases security but reduces usability compared to a shorter password (4 emojis).”

IV: Password length (4 emojis vs. 6 emojis).
DVs: Time to create, time to log in, successful recall, perceived difficulty.
6. Practical Tips
Keep the Study Manageable
Evaluate 1–2 key conditions so you don’t overwhelm participants or yourself.
Measure the Right Things
Time measurements (registration, login) are straightforward.
Error rates and recall rates require a short break or follow-up session.
Collect Subjective Feedback
A short post-task questionnaire can reveal user satisfaction and perceived security.
Plan for Variation
People’s familiarity with emojis may differ. Provide a standardized emoji set.
People’s baseline typing skills also vary, which can affect text-based vs. emoji-based comparisons.
7. Summary
Aspects to Evaluate:
Usability (time, errors, memorability, user satisfaction) and security (entropy, perceived security).
Independent Variables (IVs):
Typical choice is password type (emoji vs. text), emoji set size, or password length constraints.
Dependent Variables (DVs):
Time (create, login), error rates, success/failure, memorability, subjective ratings (usability, security).
